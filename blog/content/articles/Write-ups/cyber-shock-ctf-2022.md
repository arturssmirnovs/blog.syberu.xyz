## Overview

CyberShock 2022 was a CTF hosted by [CybExer](https://cybexer.com/) &
[CTF Tech](https://www.ctftech.com/) along with [CyberChess](https://cyberchess.lv/)
conference, organized by [CERT.lv](https://cert.lv/lv/) on October 4th of 2022, where the
participation was remote.

Compared to the last year's performance, our team "TheGoodGuys" scored a lot higher,
from 13th to 6th out of 36 competitors, this was without losing any points (taking
hints, closing challenges).

We couldn't complete the last challenges (cryptography related):

And you can see us here on the leaderboard:

![CTF leaderboard](images/cs2022-leaderboard.png)

At our level, there was close competition and if we hadn't completed a single challenge
we could have landed 9th or 10th, but in the last few minutes we completed the "Minecraft"
challenge (300pts) which boosted us to the 6th place.

Overall CTF had an interesting theme along with some defense/hardening tasks
which were checked by an automated script that I really liked, like adding a password on
an apache server and hardening an SSH server with pubkey authentication.

## Challenges

In total, there were 28 tasks split into 3 categories, "Smart Home",
"Smart City" and "Smart Airspace".

Rules:

- Only 5 challenges can be open at the same time.
- Closing a challenge reduces points.
- Taking hints reduces points.

The challenges were access by remote kali virtual machines.

- [Kali In The Browser (Guacamole)](https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/guacamole-kali-in-browser/)

### Smart Home

#### NETWORK FIX

```md
Description

Luckily the router is accessible from the WiFi.
Question
You remember that you had documented down the old routing table output.
Analyze it and find out which IP address must be configured as a gateway for the devices in network 10.5.7.0/24

Now you must be a master of Windows registry. Set of files were recovered from backup of a Windows machine.
They are at <https://static.ctftech.io/challs/registry.tar.xz>.
You have to dig deep into the files and prove that you can process every piece of data that is in there.
The files can be broken or incomplete, but this just adds fun for a proper forensic engineer, right?
QUESTION

```

#### BOARDING PASS

```md
DESCRIPTION
After fixing the problems you want to finally complete your check-in, but all the airport systems still haven't recovered from the attacks.
The airline is unable to generate you a valid boarding pass.
Security is tight and they don't allow you into the security area if you don't pass the gates.
QUESTION
You get a brilliant idea. You still have an old ticket from your previous flight in your bag.
Maybe you can change some fields and gain access using this method?

New flight information:
Booking reference(PNR): CTF123
From: Tartu Airport
To: Sydney Airport
Airline: Nordica
Flight number: 0777
Ticket format: E-ticket
Change only these values!

Submit the new barcode data as an answer.
```

#### ATIS

```md
You have a suspicion that in addition to the ransomware, data is also exfiltrated out of the ATC networks.
All outbound traffic is monitored but new data is still appearing in the dark web
From when the attacks started, ATIS has been getting continuous phone calls.
Maybe it's worth investigating?
QUESTION
Investigate the ATIS call to see if you can find anything odd!
```

#### FLIGHT-PLAN

```md
DESCRIPTION
After everything is cleared you start to wonder about the origin of this attack.
When inspecting the logs, a correlation between the start of the compromise and a pdf file arriving to the ATC can be made.
QUESTION
Inspect the flight plan, find out if there is anything malicious hidden in it.
Flag format: uuid v4
<https://static.ctftech.io/challs/flight-plan.pdf?_gl=1>*18nguau*_ga*NzI4Nzc3OTA2LjE2NjQ4NjIzOTc.*_ga_MKDT1BJ3MH*MTY2NDkxMjAyOC43LjEuMTY2NDkxMjAyOS4wLjAuMA..
```

#### WEATHER DATA

```md
DESCRIPTION
A pilot calls and complains that the weather is visibly different to what is noted in the report.
Without the correct data landing could be very difficult.
METAR is a format for reporting weather information.
A METAR weather report is predominantly used by aircraft pilots to assist in weather forecasting

During the ransomware attacks the METAR data was corrupted.
Data analysts discovered that the METAR file was split into two different files.
Every other row was moved to the second file.
Row 1 >> split1.csv
Row 2 >> split2.csv
Row 3 >> split1.csv
And so on...
QUESTION
Help the data analysts to combine the files back into one file
Answer is the md5sum of the combined file
```

#### TOP-SECRET

```md
DESCRIPTION
Management found out that the highly sensitive and top secret documents are accessible to all!
They must be hidden ASAP!
TOP-SECRET web page
TASK
You must protect this apache web server with authentication!
Configure basic authentication to protect the page
Use these credentials for auth:
Username: mulder
Password: Scully-th3-b3st!

SSH access:
Hostname: env263.target02 Port: 2222
Username: user
Password: Cool2Pass
```

#### BACKDOORED IMAGE

```md
DESCRIPTION
Developers have noticed that latest version of a SSH jumphost which they are using for remote access is acting weirdly.
When inspecting logs, they notice logins from strange accounts that should not be there.
Their own dev account password also seems to be compromised, as logins are coming from unknown IP addresses. Sysadmins have recreated the jumphost container from the latest image but with no luck.
Same activity is still seen. Could the Docker repository be hacked? Could the hackers have tampered with the image? You must find out!
QUESTION
What flag is stored in the backdoor?
Pull the jumphost image from docker.io/cybexer/ctf-jumphost:latest and find out how the image was compromised.
```

#### LEAKED DATA

```md
DESCRIPTION
You have managed to acquire an encrypted message from the exfiltrated data together with set of RSA public keys that belong to employees of the airport.
The keys are already extracted from certificates and saved to files with random names, thus anonymous.
It is known that the message is encrypted with one of those keys.
QUESTION
Find out what data was extracted from the network by decrypting it.
Recovered files
<https://static.ctftech.io/challs/output.zip?_gl=1>*1oed30*_ga*NzI4Nzc3OTA2LjE2NjQ4NjIzOTc.*_ga_MKDT1BJ3MH*MTY2NDg4NzYwMC41LjAuMTY2NDg4NzYwMC4wLjAuMA..
```

#### ATC

```md
DESCRIPTION
A teller at the airport informs you that they are currently under a ransomware attack and therefore it is not possible to complete your check-in.
You offer to help and start looking for anything useful.
While visiting the air traffic control tower, you see a ransom message appear on the radar screens.
Seems that the radars somehow still work.
Maybe not everything has been encrypted yet.
QUESTION
Investigate if you can still recover some unencrypted files from the system.
ATC Radar
